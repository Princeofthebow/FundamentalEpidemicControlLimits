The `Matlab` code in `SIR_PolicyComputation.m` and `SIR_BurstPolicyComputation.m` find the exact optimal policies for the considered SIR model for a specific set of parameters with and without bursts. In order to obtain the optimal policies the user can run the script using the desired set of parameters.
The code in `SIR_Gillespie.m` simulates using the Stochastic simulation algorithm for considered Markov jump process version of the SIR epidemic.

The files in the `Deterministic SIR` folder are the configuration files for the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman solver BOCOBP HJB (www.bocop.org) that is used to obtain the optimal policies. BOCOP computes the value functions for discretised time steps in the considered horizon for the deterministic SIR. The value function is saved in the `/valuefunction` directory and can then be processes in `MATLAB` in order to obtain the optimal policy with the files provided in `/scripts_plot/SIR/Deterministic SIR`. The value function at the end of horizon has a `*.t0` extension.
